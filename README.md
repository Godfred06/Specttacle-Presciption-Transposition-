# Spectacle-Presciption-Transposition-
Optometrists in different parts of the world represents their spectacle prescription in different formats.
They are mostly either in a minus cylindrical format or plus cylindrical format
A Spectacle prescription is made up of a speherical component, a cylindrical component and an axis.
This projects takes any spectacle prescription and transposes it to the other format.
For example, if the prescription is in the minus cylindrical format, it gives you a transposed version of that
Where the prescription will now be in a plus cylindrical format.
-1.00/-200 x 90
-1.00 represents the sphere component of the prescription
-2.00 represents the cylindrical component of the prescription
90 represents the axis of the prescription 
so the transposed version of this prescription will be
-3.00/2.00x 180

The project takes input from the user, and so users are allowed to enter in their own prescription 
Then the programs outputs the transposed version of the prescription that was entered into the program
